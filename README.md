# What is this all about?

I take machine learning papers and deconstruct them. I do this by adding commentary and writing executable code for every paragraph in the paper. Each paper is deconstructed using a Jupyter notebook which is hosted in Colab.

FYI: This repo only contains one paper that is still a work-in-progess
