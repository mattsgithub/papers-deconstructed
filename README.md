# What is this all about?

The goal of this project is to take popular machine learning papers and to deconstruct them. This is done by adding commentary, executable code, to supplement literally every sentence/paragraph in the paper. This can help you understand the paper quicker, as I have done most of the additional research for you. The integrated code helps make the paper become more of a dynamic document. Since it's in Colab, feel free to run/edit when code sections appear.

FYI: This repo only contains one paper that is still a work-in-progess
