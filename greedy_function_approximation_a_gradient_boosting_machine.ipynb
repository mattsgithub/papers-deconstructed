    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms by finding the best parameter values for a loss function and training dataset. Gradient descent is typically used to solve this. This works (roughly) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Fetch the true value for the given training example\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Compute a predicted value for the given training example\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Compute the loss given the true value and predicted value\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper step (2) is left as an unknown and the gradient is learned from data instead. This is done by setting up a supervised machine learing problem of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data = $\\{\\tilde{y_i}, x_i\\}_i^N$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tilde{y_i}$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the prediction value evaluated at the _previous_ prediction value. Least squares is chosen as the cost function. Learning the gradient is repeated at each step."

The $a_m$ is telling us each model itself has a set of parameters that need to be estimated from data. And these models do not share parameters (would be interesting to think of use-cases where parameter sharing might be beneficial). Also, I see no reason why each model must keep the same structural form (decision tree vs naive bayes). But in practice, and even in this paper, $h(x; a_m)$ is left to be a decision tree. In the package XGBoost for example, $h(x; a_m)$ is referred to as the _booster_."
