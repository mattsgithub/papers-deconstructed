    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms by finding the best parameter values for a loss function and training dataset. Gradient descent is typically used to solve this. This works (roughly) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Fetch the true value for the given training example\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Compute a predicted value for the given training example\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Compute the loss given the true value and predicted value\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper step (2) is left as an unknown and the gradient is _directly_ learned from data instead. This is done by setting up a supervised machine learing problem of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Dataset = $\\{ (\\tilde{y_i}, x_i) \\}_i^N$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tilde{y_i}$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the prediction value evaluated at the _previous_ prediction value. Learning the gradient is repeated at each step."

We take a derivative with respect to a function!"

(The $m$ denotes which model we are referring to--there are $m$ of them). Each model is denoted as $h(x; a_m)$. The $a_m$ is telling us each model itself has a set of parameters that need to be estimated from data. And these models do not share parameters (would be interesting to think of use-cases where parameter sharing might be beneficial). Also, I see no reason why each model must keep the same structural form (decision tree vs naive bayes). But in practice, and even in this paper, $h(x; a_m)$ is left to be a decision tree. In the package XGBoost for example, $h(x; a_m)$ is referred to as the _booster_."

    "><i> In the special case where $y \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ and the loss function $L(y, F)$ depends on y and F only through their product $L(y, F) = L(yF)$, the analogy of boosting (9), (10) to steepest-descent minimization has been noted in the machine learning literature. Duffy and Hemlbold elegantly exploit this analogy to motivate their GeoLev and and GeoArc procedures. The quantity $yF$ is call the \"margin\" and the steepest-descent is performed in the space of margin values, rather than the space of function values F. The latter approach permits application to more general loss functions where the notion of margins is not apparent. Durker employes a different strategy of casting regression in the framework of classification in the context of the AdaBoost algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "It seems they make aware they are not the first to generalize AdaBoost. AdaBoost was generalized to margin values but a generalization to optimizing over function space direclty is indeed, the most general. It's a nice framework, because it leads to new classes of algorithms.\n",
